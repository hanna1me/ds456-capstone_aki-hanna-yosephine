Aki Wada Hanna Chang Yosephine Manihuruk

## Research Question

> How can we identify redundant/unique segments in public transit routes
> and micro mobility data in Minneapolis, and how can we use the
> observations to optimize inter-Minneapolis travel?

## Motivation

Our project stemmed from our shared interest in spacial data analysis,
one of its specific trait being its versatility. We agreed upon
transportation, and more specifically public transit and micro mobility.

With the rise of urbanization, cities are facing increasing challenges
in managing transportation systems efficiently. Redundant routes can
lead to wasted resources, increased traffic congestion, and higher
emissions. By identifying and optimizing these routes, we can improve
the overall efficiency of public transit and micro mobility options in
Minneapolis, making it easier for residents to navigate the city while
reducing environmental impact.
